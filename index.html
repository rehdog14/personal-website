		<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center">Hey. My Name is Charles Rehder and I am a Math and Computer Science major at the University of Illnois Urbana-Champaign.
		I am from Chisago Lakes, Minnesota and I love playing video games on my computer (Mostly Stardew Valley and whatever indie
		game looks cool). I also love hip-hop music, especially Kanye West and A Tribe Called Quest and collect/listen to vinyl when I have
		the money. I like to think of myself as pretty handy with audio equipment and appreciate a good setup when I hear one.
		I've built a few PCs whether they be for me or helping out a friend and usually keep up with the most recent tech news. Also I love my
		two dogs Ruby and Henry. Feel free to contact me if you want to hire me or just want to talk. Have a great day.</p>
